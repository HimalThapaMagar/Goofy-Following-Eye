# goofy_eyes

A new Flutter project.

This project is an attempt to recreate the "goofy eye" effect that follows the user's cursor. I found a similar implementation in JavaScript on a Fireship video and decided to see if it could be done in Flutter.
By the way, finally found the use of trigonometry I studied in class 9 through 12. haha

## Inspiration

The idea for this project came from a video by Fireship, where a similar effect was created using JavaScript.

## Goal

The goal is to implement the same "goofy eye" effect in Flutter to explore the capabilities of the framework.

## How it works

The eye will follow the user's touch or cursor movements on the screen, creating a playful and interactive experience.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to have Flutter installed. Follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your environment.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HimalThapaMagar/Goofy-Following-Eye.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd Goofy-Following-Eye

3. Run the app:
    ```sh
    flutter run

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Flutter can be used to create fun and interactive UI effects. Feel free to explore and modify the code to create your own variations!
